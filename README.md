## Description
The intension of the project is to show differences between ***`Java`*** and ***`Scala`***.\
This project is an spitting image of the project made in *`Java`* (you can see the project [**here**](https://github.com/Mikosztyla/PO_2023_SRO1640_GOSZTYLA))

The simulation begins on a rectangular map, where Animals and their food (grass `*`) are places.\
Then, the movement of the Animals is provided. Animal can be moved by 4 arguments:
- `f` - forward
- `b` - backward
- `r` - right
- `l` - left

And it's movement is presented in terminal by 4 direction, which it is facing:
- `N` - North
- `E` - East
- `S` - South
- `W` - West

This is how it looks:
